### How to Use:

1.) To start the server in the terminal type **node server.js**

2.) Open localhost:5000 in the browser of your choice and view the website.

3.) Type in the input to print words on the page.

4.) Click the button to delete your inputs.

#### How to End-to-End Test:

In the command line start the server (see step 1 in previous section).

Type **protractor test/integration/config.js** in the command line.

This will run the end-to-end tests.

Note: You must have the server running to have these tests pass.
